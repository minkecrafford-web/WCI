### 🌐 Deployment Options:

#### 1. **Static Hosting (Recommended)**:
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder
- **Vercel**: Connect to GitHub and deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Upload files to gh-pages branch
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Upload to S3 bucket

#### 2. **Traditional Web Hosting**:
- Upload all files from `dist` folder to your web root
- Ensure `index.html` is in the root directory

#### 3. **Quick Deploy Commands**:
```bash
# Netlify
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist

# Vercel
npm install -g vercel
cd dist && vercel --prod
```

### 🔧 Maintenance:
- **After any changes**: Run `python3 optimize.py` to rebuild
- **Before deployment**: Test the production build locally
- **Keep source files**: Never edit files in the `dist` folder directly

### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Protection works best on modern browsers
- Some corporate networks may override these protections
- Use HTTPS hosting for better security
- The obfuscated code is still functional but much harder to understand

### 💡 Optional Enhancements:
- Enable HTTPS on your hosting provider
- Use a CDN for global performance
- Add rate limiting on your server
- Monitor website traffic and security
